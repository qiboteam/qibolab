Alternative way of comparing sequences:
```py
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        if len(self) != len(other):
            return False

        sdelays = []
        odelays = []
        for sel, oel in zip(self, other):
            # batch delays
            if isinstance(sel[1], Delay) and isinstance(oel[1], Delay):
                sdelays.append(sel)
                odelays.append(oel)
                continue
            if sel != oel:
                return False
            # compare delays without internal order
            if set(sdelays) != set(odelays):
                return False
            # reset delays
            sdelays.clear()
            odelays.clear()
```

For the time being, there is no specific need of comparing sequences,
other than for testing purposes.
Moreover, the proper way of testing sequences equality is sorted by
channel, within aligned chunks. So, even the one above is only a certain
approximation.
