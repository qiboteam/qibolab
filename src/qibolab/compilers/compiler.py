class Compiler:
    """Compiler that transforms a :class:`qibo.models.Circuit` to a
    :class:`qibolab.pulses.PulseSequence`.

    The transformation is done using a dictionary of rules which map each Qibo gate to a
    pulse sequence and some virtual Z-phases.

    A rule is a function that takes two argumens:
        - gate (:class:`qibo.gates.abstract.Gate`): Gate object to be compiled.
        - platform (:class:`qibolab.platforms.abstract.AbstractPlatform`): Platform object to read
            native gate pulses from.

    and returns:
        - sequence (:class:`qibolab.pulses.PulseSequence`): Sequence of pulses that implement
            the given gate.
        - virtual_z_phases (dict): Dictionary mapping qubits to virtual Z-phases induced by the gate.

    See :class:`qibolab.compilers.default` for an example of a compiler implementation.
