    This is the n-dimensional version of :func:`np.random.choice`, which instead of
    vectorizing over the picked elements, it assumes them to be just a plain integer
    range (which in turn could be used to index a suitable array, if relevant), while it
    allows the probabilities to be higher dimensional.

    The ``probabilities`` argument specifies the set of probabilities, which are
    intended to be normalized arrays over the innermost dimension. Such that the whole
    array describe a set of ``probabilities.shape[:-1]`` discrete distributions.

    `samples` is instead the number of samples to extract from each distribution.

        two-dimensional version.
