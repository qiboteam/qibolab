class QrmRf(ClusterModule):
    """Qblox Cluster Qubit Readout Module RF driver.

    Qubit Readout Module RF (QRM-RF) is an instrument that integrates an arbitrary wave generator, a digitizer,
    a local oscillator and a mixer. It has one output and one input port. Each port has a path0 and path1 for the
    i(in-phase) and q(quadrature) components of the RF signal. The sampling rate of its ADC/DAC is 1 GSPS.
    https://www.qblox.com/cluster

    The class aims to simplify the configuration of the instrument, exposing only those parameters most frequently
    used and hiding other more complex settings.

    A reference to the underlying `qblox_instruments.qcodes_drivers.qcm_qrm.QRM_QCM` object is provided via the
    attribute `device`, allowing the advanced user to gain access to the features that are not exposed directly
    by the class.

    In order to accelerate the execution, the instrument settings are cached, so that the communication with the
    instrument only happens when the parameters change. This caching is done with the method
    `_set_device_parameter(target, *parameters, value)`.

        ports = A dictionary giving access to the input and output ports objects.

            - ports['o1']: Output port
            - ports['i1']: Input port

            - ports['o1'].channel (int | str): the id of the refrigerator channel the output port o1 is connected to.
            - ports['o1'].attenuation (int): (mapped to qrm.out0_att) Controls the attenuation applied to the output
              port. It must be a multiple of 2.
            - ports['o1'].lo_enabled (bool): (mapped to qrm.out0_in0_lo_en) Enables or disables the local oscillator.
            - ports['o1'].lo_frequency (int): (mapped to qrm.out0_in0_lo_freq) Sets the frequency of the local oscillator.
            - ports['o1'].gain (float): (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].gain_awg_path0 and qrm.sequencers[0].gain_awg_path1)
              Sets the gain on both paths of the output port.
            - ports['o1'].hardware_mod_en (bool): (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].mod_en_awg) Enables pulse modulation
              in hardware. When set to False, pulse modulation is done in software, at the host computer, and the
              modulated pulse waveform is uploaded to the instrument. When set to True, the envelope of the pulse
              is uploaded to the instrument and it is modulated in real time by the FPGA of the instrument, using
              the sequencer nco (numerically controlled oscillator).
            - ports['o1'].nco_freq (int): (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].nco_freq). Mapped, but not configurable from
              the runcard.
            - ports['o1'].nco_phase_offs = (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].nco_phase_offs). Mapped, but not configurable
              from the runcard.

            - ports['i1'].channel (int | str): the id of the refrigerator channel the input port o1 is connected to.
            - ports['i1'].acquisition_hold_off (int): Delay between the moment the readout pulse starts to be played and
              the start of the acquisition, in ns. It must be > 0 and multiple of 4.
            - ports['i1'].acquisition_duration (int): (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].integration_length_acq) Duration
              of the pulse acquisition, in ns. It must be > 0 and multiple of 4.
            - ports['i1'].hardware_demod_en (bool): (mapped to qrm.sequencers[0].demod_en_acq) Enables demodulation
              and integration of the acquired pulses in hardware. When set to False, the filtration, demodulation
              and integration of the acquired pulses is done at the host computer. When set to True, the
              demodulation, integration and discretization of the pulse is done in real time at the FPGA of the
              instrument.

                - Sequencer 0 is used always for acquisitions and it is the first sequencer used to synthesise pulses.
                - Sequencer 1 to 6 are used as needed to synthesise simultaneous pulses on the same channel (required in
                  multiplexed readout) or when the memory of the default sequencers rans out.

        classification_parameters (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters needed classify the state of each qubit.
            from a single shot measurement:
        qubit_id (dict): the id of the qubit
            rotation_angle (float): 0   # in degrees 0.0<=v<=360.0. The angle of the rotation applied at the
            origin of the i q plane, that put the centroids of the state ``|0>`` and state ``|1>`` in a horizontal line.
            The rotation puts the centroid of state ``|1>`` to the right side of centroid of state ``|0>``.
        threshold (float): 0        # in V. The real component of the point along the horizontal line
            connecting both state centroids (after being rotated), that maximises the fidelity of the
            classification.

        channels (list): A list of the channels to which the instrument is connected.

            -  real-time sweepers of

                - pulse frequency (requires hardware modulation)
