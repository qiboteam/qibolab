class QcmBb(ClusterModule):
    """Qblox Cluster Qubit Control Module Baseband driver.

    Qubit Control Module (QCM) is an arbitratry wave generator with two DACs connected to
    four output ports. It can sinthesise either four independent real signals or two
    complex signals, using ports 0 and 2 to output the i(in-phase) component and
    ports 1 and 3 the q(quadrature) component. The sampling rate of its DAC is 1 GSPS.
    https://www.qblox.com/cluster

    The class aims to simplify the configuration of the instrument, exposing only
    those parameters most frequencly used and hiding other more complex components.

    A reference to the underlying `qblox_instruments.qcodes_drivers.qcm_qrm.QRM_QCM`
    object is provided via the attribute `device`, allowing the advanced user to gain
    access to the features that are not exposed directly by the class.

    In order to accelerate the execution, the instrument settings are cached, so that
    the communication with the instrument only happens when the parameters change.
    This caching is done with the method `_set_device_parameter(target, *parameters, value)`.
