Performing the first experiment
===============================

Define the platform
-------------------

To launch experiments on quantum hardware, users have first to define their platform.
To define a platform the user needs to provide a folder with the following structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    my_platform/
        platform.py
        parameters.json

where ``platform.py`` contains instruments information and ``parameters.json`` includes calibration parameters.

More information about defining platforms is provided in :doc:`../tutorials/lab` and several examples can be found
at the `TII QRC lab dedicated repository <https://github.com/qiboteam/qibolab_platforms_qrc>`_.

For a first experiment, let's define a single qubit platform at the path previously specified.
In this example, the qubit is controlled by a Quantum Machines cluster that contains Octaves,
although minimal changes are needed to use other devices.

.. code-block:: python

    # my_platform/platform.py

    import pathlib

    from qibolab import (
        AcquisitionChannel,
        Channel,
        ConfigKinds,
        DcChannel,
        IqChannel,
        Platform,
        Qubit,
    )
    from qibolab.instruments.qm import Octave, QmConfigs, QmController

    # folder containing runcard with calibration parameters
    FOLDER = pathlib.Path.cwd()

    # Register QM-specific configurations for parameters loading
    ConfigKinds.extend([QmConfigs])


    def create():
        # Define qubit
        qubits = {
            0: Qubit(
                drive="0/drive",
                probe="0/probe",
                acquisition="0/acquisition",
            )
        }

        # Create channels and connect to instrument ports
        channels = {}
        qubit = qubits[0]
        # Readout
        channels[qubit.probe] = IqChannel(
            device="octave1", path="1", mixer=None, lo="0/probe/lo"
        )
        # Acquire
        channels[qubit.acquisition] = AcquisitionChannel(
            device="octave1", path="1", probe=qubit.probe
        )
        # Drive
        channels[qubit.drive] = IqChannel(
            device="octave1", path="2", mixer=None, lo="0/drive/lo"
        )

        # Define Quantum Machines instruments
        octaves = {
            "octave1": Octave("octave5", port=101, connectivity="con1"),
        }
        controller = QmController(
            name="qm",
            address="192.168.0.101:80",
            octaves=octaves,
            channels=channels,
            calibration_path=FOLDER,
        )

        # Define and return platform
        return Platform.load(
            path=FOLDER, instruments=[controller], qubits=qubits, resonator_type="3D"
        )


.. note::

    The ``platform.py`` file must contain a ``create_function`` with the following signature:

    .. code-block:: python

        import pathlib
        from qibolab import Platform


        def create() -> Platform:
            """Function that generates Qibolab platform."""

And the we can define the runcard ``my_platform/parameters.json``:

.. code-block:: json

        "settings": {
            "nshots": 1024,

            },
            "two_qubit": {}
        }
    }


Setting up the environment
--------------------------

After defining the platform, we must instruct ``qibolab`` of the location of the platform(s).
We need to define the path that contains platform folders.
This can be done using an environment variable:
for Unix based systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    export QIBOLAB_PLATFORMS=<path-platform-folders>

for Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $env:QIBOLAB_PLATFORMS="<path-to-platform-folders>"

To avoid having to repeat this export command for every session, this line can be added to the ``.bashrc`` file (or alternatives such as ``.zshrc``).


Run the experiment
------------------

Let's take the `Resonator spectroscopy experiment` defined and detailed in :doc:`../tutorials/calibration`.
Since it is a rather simple experiment, it can be used to perform a fast sanity-check on the platform.

We leave to the dedicated tutorial a full explanation of the experiment, but here it is the required code:

.. testcode:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from qibolab import (
        AcquisitionType,
        AveragingMode,
        Parameter,
        PulseSequence,
        Sweeper,
        create_platform,
    )

    # load the platform from ``dummy.py`` and ``dummy.json``
    platform = create_platform("dummy")

    qubit = platform.qubits[0]
    natives = platform.natives.single_qubit[0]
    # define the pulse sequence
    sequence = natives.MZ.create_sequence()

    # define a sweeper for a frequency scan
    f0 = platform.config(qubit.probe).frequency  # center frequency
    sweeper = Sweeper(
        parameter=Parameter.frequency,
        range=(f0 - 2e8, f0 + 2e8, 1e6),
        channels=[qubit.probe],
    )

    # perform the experiment using specific options
    results = platform.execute(
        [sequence],
        [[sweeper]],
        nshots=1000,
        relaxation_time=50,
        averaging_mode=AveragingMode.CYCLIC,
        acquisition_type=AcquisitionType.INTEGRATION,
    )
    _, acq = next(iter(sequence.acquisitions))

    # plot the results
    signal = results[acq.id]
    amplitudes = signal[..., 0] + 1j * signal[..., 1]
    frequencies = sweeper.values

    plt.title("Resonator Spectroscopy")
    plt.xlabel("Frequencies [Hz]")
    plt.ylabel("Amplitudes [a.u.]")

    plt.plot(frequencies, amplitudes)
