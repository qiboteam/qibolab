Qibolab is the dedicated `Qibo <https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo>`_ package for
quantum hardware control. This module automates the implementation of quantum
circuits on quantum hardware.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

Qibolab's architecture comprises two primary components:


- the :ref:`Platform API <main_doc_platform>`, which facilitates the custom allocation
  of quantum hardware platforms and laboratory setups, and
- its :ref:`Experiment API <main_doc_experiment>`, which provides the tools to define
  arbitrary experiments, based on pulse sequences, for execution on the configured
  platforms.

Platformsâ€™ definition involve describing the arrangement of physical devices using
Qibolab's abstractions. This is achieved through provided :ref:`drivers
<main_doc_instruments>`, which offer support for both commercial and open-source
firmware for hardware control.

In addition to pulse execution, Qibolab platforms function as backends for :ref:`quantum
circuit deployment <tutorials_circuits>` on hardware. This functionality is enabled by
an integrated circuit :ref:`compiler <main_doc_compiler>`, which translates quantum
circuits into pulse sequences.


Qibolab is designed to be used in conjunction with `Qibocal
<https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal>`_, which supplies a comprehensive suite of
calibration procedures for any Qibolab-based platform.
